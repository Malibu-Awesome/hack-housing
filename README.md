# Malibu Awesome Team: Zillow Hack Housing Hackathon

The purpose of this app is to provide a budget calculator tool for first time homebuyers that will allow them to determine if a house and neighborhood is in their budget. You will find our app at [Github](https://github.com/Malibu-Awesome). If you'd like to suggest changes or improvements to this app, feel free to send a pull request.

This application was developed on February 7th, 2015 for the [Zillow Hack Housing Hackthon](http://investors.zillow.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=892685).
